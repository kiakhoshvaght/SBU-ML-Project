    "HDBSCAN is a clustering algorithm based on DBSCAN. The difference is that HDBSCAN uses varying epsilon to find the best stable epsilon. So that HDBSCAN is parameterless and has no challenge over finding the best parameter. HDBSCAN converts DBSCAN into a hierachical clustering. \n",

    "Firstly we need to make our model robust against noises. We need an inexpensive way for that. The simplest way is to fing the distance to kth neighbour. If we have distance matrix (Which we will have to compute it anyway) we can use it. alternatively if our metric is supported (and dimension is low) this is the sort of query that kd-trees are good for. Let's formalise this and (following the DBSCAN, LOF, and HDBSCAN literature) call it the core distance defined for parameter k for a point x and denote as corek(x)\n",
    ". Now we need a way to spread apart points with low density (correspondingly high core distance). The simple way to do this is to define a new distance metric between points which we will call (again following the literature) the mutual reachability distance. We define mutual reachability distance as follows:\n",
